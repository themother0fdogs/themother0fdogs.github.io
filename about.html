        <p class = "indent">Hello! My name is Lynh Casidy and I will give you some insight on my experiences, skills, and overall background of who I am.
             In March 2023, I will be gradating with my Bachelor of Science Degree in Software Development from Western Governors University(WGU). 
             At WGU, I learned the basics of data management, project management, UI/UX design, and programming languages such as SQL, Java, C++, and HTML/CSS.
             Currently, I reside in Culpeper, Virginia with my husband and my two dogs, Orion and Atlas. 
             I work remotely as an Internet Safety Evaluator for Telus International while going to school full-time.

        <p class = "indent">
            Prior to going to WGU, I went to school to become a Medical Assistant and then further progressed myself in the medical field by going for my Bachelor's in Nursing.
            I finished most of my nursing curriculum, but decided to leave the school after realizing my lack of enjoyment for the career. I loved all of my patients, but the work/life balance
            was nonexistent. 
            After leaving nursing school, I went to work with animals as a Veterinary Technician. I only knew medicine, so I figured that I'd try it out to see if I liked the animal setting better. 
            I loved being a Veterinary Technician; however, it was an emotionally taxing job. I would get very close to owners and their pets and when they felt pain, I felt it as well.
            In 2020, I decided that I wanted to try a different path in life, so I made the switch into Information Technology. 
            I have always been interested in tech, so I revisited the idea of becoming a software developer. Now, here I am today, studying software development!

<p class = "indent">I have extensive knowledge in human and animal medicine, but before studying medicine I was in graphic designing. My highschool was focused on career and technical education. 
            For four years, I studied graphic designing along with the general high school education. The graphic design curriculum taught me how to work in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro.
            The curriculum also taught me television broadcasting skills and web communication. Along with my school curriculum, I would code in HTML to edit my personal profiles on social media as a hobby.
            After high school, I would do small projects for friends and family to keep my creativity going. My commisioned work were mostly of household items or baked goods.
            I have even been commissioned to make dog treats for a dog park event and a doggie daycare.
            To this day, I still enjoy creating art whether it be graphic designing, creating a website, editing photos, painting, creating household projects, or decorating baked goods.

        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p class = "indent">My parents were immigrants from Vietnam and I am the first born out of three children. My parents left everything that they've known for the past 30 years to live in a new country.
            I watched both of my parents work hard to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.  
            Growing up, I had to figure things out on my own sometimes because my parents weren't sure either. 
            I remember my father having stacks of manuals that he would read through. He loved to learn new things and always wanted to figure out the "why" and "hows" in life. 
            I wanted to be just like him when I was a kid, so whatever interested me I would learn more about it.
            Being a child of immigrants has really taught me about hardwork, independence, and perseverance.
