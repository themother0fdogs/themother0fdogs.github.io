        <p class = "indent">Hello! My name is Lynh Casidy and this section will give you some insight on my experiences, skills, and overall background of who I am.
        Currently, I reside in Culpeper, Virginia with my husband and my two dogs, Orion and Atlas. I work remotely as a Internet Safety Evaluator for Telus International while 
            going to school full-time. My hobbies include baking human and dog treats, training and agility work with my dogs, and running. On my off time, I like to play cozy or puzzle games on my PC or Nintendo Switch.
            My favorite shows that I could play on repeat are Bob's Burgers and The Office. I also enjoy fantasy series such as Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings.

        <p class = "indent">
            In March 2023, I will be graduating with my Bachelor's degree in Software Development at Western Governors University(WGU). 
            Prior to going to WGU, I went to school to become a Medical Assistant and then further progressed myself in the medical field by going for my Bachelor's in Nursing.
            I finished most of my nursing curriculum, but decided to leave the school after realizing my lack of enjoyment for the career.
            Afterwards, I went to work with animals as a Veterinary Technician for a slight change of pace. It was still medicine, but it was different since I have always wanted to work
            with animals. I loved being a Veterinary Technician. However, it was an emotionally taxing job because I would get very close to owners and their pets and when they felt pain, I felt it as well.
            In 2020, I decided to make the switch into Information Technology. I have always been interested in tech, so I revisited the idea of becoming a software developer to see if I enjoyed learning the material. 
            In the end, I found more enjoyment studying software development than studying medicine.

<p class = "indent">I have extensive knowledge in human and animal medicine, but before studying medicine I was in graphic designing. My highschool was focused on career and technical education. 
            For four years, I studied graphic designing along with the general high school education. The graphic design curriculum taught me how to work in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro.
            The curriculum also taught me television broadcasting skills and web communication. Along with my school curriculum, I would code in HTML to edit my personal profiles on social media as a hobby.
            After high school, I would do small projects for friends and family to keep my creativity going. My commisioned work were mostly of household items or baked goods.
            I have even been commissioned to make dog treats for a dog park event and a doggie daycare.
            To this day, I still enjoy creating art whether it be graphic designing, editing photos, painting, creating household projects, or decorating baked goods.

        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p class = "indent">My parents were immigrants from Vietnam and I was the first born out of three children. I had to learn how to navigate through life without any guidance because
            my parents didn't quite understand how things worked in America. Because of this, I became independent at a very young age. I have worked hard for everything that I have now
            and I will continue to have a good work ethic.
