TITLE:
My Portfolio Website

PURPOSE:
I created this website to display my resume, work experience, and skills for prospecting employers. 
Being new into software development and IT in general, I wanted to be able to show that I have the capability 
to learn how to do something I've never done before. I learned how to use GitHub pages to host my own website. 
My website is a responsive design, so user can view my page on a desktop, mobile phone, or tablet.
